# Diff-algorithm
Javascript diff algorithm ( https://dmitri.fi/diff.html )

1. Type old and modified texts in separate text areas and click Compare button
2. Differences between the contents will be shown in blue and yellow
3. Text that is longer will always be shown in blue color.

!My solution is using web worker for performance reasons, if you are using Visual Studio Code then it won't work because browser won't allow you to access files on your machine.
I'm working on WebStorm which allows you to make that kind of projects and it works online perfectly fine as you can see on my link provided.
